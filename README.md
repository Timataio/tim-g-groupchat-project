# tim-g-groupchat-project
A group chat client and server designed to be run on the University of Scranton's freebsd servers. The command line interface lets users create and join groups with password protection and log out and in as necessary.

server-thread-2020.c was written by Dr. Yaodong Bi, and my group members wrote some of the other helper functions.
